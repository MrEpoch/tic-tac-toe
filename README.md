# tic-tac-toe

Few weeks ago i found Odin project as best learning platform for me, i took edx harvard cs50, went to the bunch of tutorials on youtube, learned on scrimba through interactive tutorials, even tried some programming games, but nothing was so good as odin project

My project of tic tac toe game, it took me few good hours making it, but nothing beats time debbuging it.

I plan in future to make that AI, it doesn't look that hard, but i feel like it will take too much time
